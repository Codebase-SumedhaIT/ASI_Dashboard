## Frontend Components

### 1. ProjectManagement.jsx
Main component that includes the "Define Project Plans" button.

**Key Features:**
- Project and domain validation
- Integration with selection modal
- Error handling for missing projects/domains

### 2. ProjectSelectionModal.jsx
Modal for selecting project and domain before opening the plan modal.

**Key Features:**
- Dropdown selection for projects and domains
- Form validation
- Clean UI with proper styling

### 3. ProjectPlanModal.jsx
Main modal for managing project plans.

**Key Features:**
- Tabbed interface (Requirements, Testcases, Assertions, Functional Coverage)
- Form sections for adding new items
- Data tables for viewing existing items
- Status and priority management
- Time tracking (estimated vs actual hours)
- Date planning (start/end dates)

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Setting up the Database
Run the SQL schema file to create the necessary tables:

```sql
-- Run the dv_planned_work_schema.sql file
source dv_planned_work_schema.sql;
```

### 2. Accessing the Feature
1. Navigate to the Project Management page
2. Ensure you have at least one project and domain created
3. Click the "ðŸ“‹ Define Project Plans" button
4. Select your project and domain from the dropdown
5. Use the tabbed interface to manage different aspects of your project plan

### 3. Adding New Items
1. Select the appropriate tab (Requirements, Testcases, etc.)
2. Fill out the form on the left side
3. Click the submit button to create the item
4. The item will appear in the table on the right side

### 4. Managing Status and Priority
- **Status Options:** planned, in_progress, completed, blocked
- **Priority Options:** low, medium, high, critical
- Use the dropdown menus to update status and priority

### 5. Time Tracking
- Enter estimated hours when creating items
- Update actual hours as work progresses
- Track planned vs actual start/end dates

## Technical Details

### Backend
- **Framework:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Authentication:** JWT-based
- **File:** `backend/routes/plannedWork.js`

### Frontend
- **Framework:** React with TypeScript
- **Styling:** CSS with modern gradients and animations
- **Components:** Modular design with reusable components
- **State Management:** React hooks (useState, useEffect)

### Database
- **Engine:** MySQL
- **Schema:** Normalized design with foreign key relationships
- **Indexes:** Performance optimized with proper indexing
- **Soft Deletes:** Uses `is_deleted` flag for data integrity

## Error Handling

### Backend Errors
- Database connection errors
- Validation errors
- Authentication errors
- Foreign key constraint violations

### Frontend Errors
- Network connectivity issues
- Form validation errors
- Missing project/domain errors
- API response errors

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication:** All endpoints require valid JWT token
2. **Authorization:** Users can only access their own data
3. **Input Validation:** Server-side validation for all inputs
4. **SQL Injection:** Uses parameterized queries
5. **XSS Protection:** Input sanitization and output encoding

## Performance Considerations

1. **Database Indexes:** Proper indexing on frequently queried columns
2. **Pagination:** Large datasets can be paginated
3. **Caching:** Consider implementing Redis for frequently accessed data
4. **Optimization:** Efficient queries with proper joins

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create new requirements
- [ ] Create new testcases
- [ ] Create new assertions
- [ ] Create new functional coverage
- [ ] Update existing items
- [ ] Delete items
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Test responsive design
- [ ] Test with different browsers

### Automated Testing (Future)
- Unit tests for API endpoints
- Integration tests for database operations
- Frontend component tests
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
